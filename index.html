        </div>
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="strong">
          We are a group of passionate avionics students from the University of
          Saad Dahleb Blida 1, Institute of Aeronautics and Space Studies.
          Currently in our third year of avionics, we are deeply fascinated by
          electronics, with a particular focus on the electronics of airplanes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shared passion has led us to create this website, AeroNova_X,
          where we showcase all the projects and innovations we've developed as
          a team, as well as the exciting ideas and projects from our fellow
          students. AeroNova_X is not just a platform for our current work, but
          a space where future aerospace innovations will come to life.

        <h2>The Name</h2>
        <p>
          The name "AeroNova_X" embodies the spirit of innovation, precision,
          and the limitless possibilities in the world of aeronautics. "Aero" is
          derived from the Greek word for air, symbolizing the team’s deep
          connection to the principles of flight and aerospace engineering.
          "Nova" reflects the concept of a new, bright star—representing the
          team's ambition to shine brightly in the realm of RC aviation and
          engineering. The "X" at the end adds an element of mystery and
          potential, hinting at the unknown frontiers the team is eager to
          explore, from advanced design innovations to cutting-edge technologies
          in the RC aviation world. AeroNova_X isn’t just a name—it’s a vision,
          a mission to push boundaries and redefine what’s possible in the
          skies, inspiring both current and future generations to reach for new
          heights.

        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Our idea began with a simple thought: as a team, we wanted to share
          our work and the work of future students with the broader community.
          Why not make it available to other students and even professional
          recruiters? By showcasing our projects on AeroNova_X, we offer a
          platform where others can highlight their achievements, adding them to
          their CVs for future opportunities. However, we must not forget the
          true driving force behind this project: Teacher Choutri, who teaches
          the "TP Instrument de Bord" module. He graciously provided us with the
          opportunity to demonstrate our potential and showcase what we are
          capable of. Thanks to his support, we are here today, bringing this
          vision to life.

        <p>
          We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our sponsor, the
          University of Saad Dahleb Blida 1, for their continuous support and
          for providing the foundation that allowed us to embark on this
          journey. We are also incredibly thankful to Teacher Choutri, whose
          generosity and guidance have been instrumental in making our project
          possible. He provided us with the materials, funding, and all the
          necessary resources we needed. More importantly, he encouraged us to
          think outside the box, explore new ideas, and continuously search for
          innovative solutions. His belief in our potential has been a driving
          force, and we are truly grateful for his support.

        <h2>Presentation of the Project</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the design and features of the AeroNovaX RC plane. The
          AeroNova_X_1 is the first RC plane developed by our team as part of
          the AeroNova_X project. We chose to integrate advanced avionics and
          control systems, using the Pixhawk 2.4.8 as the central
          microcontroller for flight management. The Pixhawk is a
          high-performance flight controller capable of stabilizing the plane,
          handling navigation via GPS, and enabling autonomous flight with
          precision. The airplane is powered by a Brushless Motor 2212 with an
          8×6 propeller and utilizes a LiPo battery for efficient power
          management. With a wingspan of 810 mm and a total weight of 560 g
          (with electronics), this plane was designed for performance,
          efficiency, and easy handling. Through detailed aerodynamic
          calculations, we’ve ensured that the plane can achieve the necessary
          lift and thrust to perform as required.

      <p>
        To all future students of AeroNova_X, I want you to know that this
        journey we've started is just the beginning of something extraordinary.
        The work you do here isn't just about creating a website or designing an
        RC plane—it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible, about
        dreaming big and daring to turn those dreams into reality. Every line of
        code you write, every design you shape, and every idea you bring to life
        will be a step forward in creating something that will inspire others
        for years to come. You are not just building a website, you are building
        a legacy, a testament to your dedication, creativity, and vision. Think
        of all the future students, just like you, who will look at the projects
        you've helped create and feel inspired to take on the challenges of
        tomorrow. The world is waiting for the next generation of innovators,
        engineers, and dreamers—and that generation is you. So, take pride in
        every task you take on, no matter how small it may seem. You have the
        power to make this site better, to create more projects, and to push
        AeroNova_X to heights we have yet to imagine. Your passion, your hard
        work, and your brilliance will inspire others to believe that anything
        is possible. This is your chance to leave a mark, to show the world what
        you're made of. Don't hold back. Keep improving, keep innovating, and
        keep dreaming—because what you do here will echo for generations. Let's
        make something beautiful together, something that will change lives, and
        something that we can all be proud of. This is your time. The future is
        in your hands.
